# Qortal-App Repository

## What is Qortal
Qortal is a replacement for the traditional internet that provides user ownership of their data, 1 account for ALL websites, censorship immunity, and significantly more privacy and security than regular websites.

Instead of centralized servers, Terms of Service, and databases constantly getting hacked, users on Qortal share copies of the websites they visit with each other, and all code is run on the user's machine.
Websites and the data they use such as videos, audio, blog posts, etc. are stored on the Qortal Data Network either publicly, or an encrypted format that only the user or other authorized accounts can see.

## Published Qortal-Apps
The following Q-Apps are open source and published by the Qortal Dev Team onto the Qortal Data Network.
1. Q-Blog: A blogging platform that lets you publish posts consisting of text as well as images, audio and video files hosted on QDN. This can easily be forked to create replacements to most social media sites such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, etc.
2. Q-Mail: Email application that lets you contact anyone with a Qortal Name in complete privacy. It can also communicate with groups privately and build threads that act like a prototype Discord.
3. Q-Shop: Buy and sell products with QORT in a peer to peer fashion.
4. Q-Fund: Create or donate to crowdfunds to support projects you want to use.

## Languages
Q-Apps support any client-side javascript frameworks or approaches. Initial examples will be in React and vanilla javascript, but these are by no means the only options for structuring a Q-App.

## Templates
This directory contains both Javascript and Typescript templates that are a great starting point for building a new Q-App.

## Documentation
See: [Q-Apps documentation](https://github.com/Qortal/qortal/blob/master/Q-Apps.md) for developer docs and info on how to get started.
